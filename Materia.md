### what is kotlin?
kotlin is a general purpose language which supports both functional programming and object-oriented programming paradigms.
it´s a open source project.
like java, kotlin is a statically typed language. however you can omit the types and it often looks as concise as some other dynamically-typed languages.
kotlin is safe, it´s even safer than java in the terms that kotlin compiler can help to prevent even more possible types of errors. 
one of the main characteristics of kotlin is its good interoperability with java and you can use any java library.
kotlin is a pragmatic language for industry, it´s not a research project that just tries some ideas.
it´s based on many existing languages and it tries to reuse what works there.
you often can find what language was the source of inspiration for some kotlin features.
kotlin can be used for android applications but also as a server side language, and you can use kotlin whenever you use java before.
kotlin has other target platforms, like kotlin/jvm, kotlin/js and kotlin/native.
this course focuses on kotlin/jvm
